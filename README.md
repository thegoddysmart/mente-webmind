## What Do We Want to Build?

People often browse through countless websites, but when they want to recall a specific information later, it’s difficult to find the relevant link or remember the context of what they saved. Existing bookmarking tools only save URLs, which are not sufficient for recalling specific details. We want to build an innovative personal knowledge management tool or a platform that allows users to save website links and intelligently scrape, summarize, and categorize the content for future reference. Later, users can search their saved links based on keywords, phrases, or context, making it much easier to recall the exact piece of information they need. We also want to allow users to add theirnotes and reflections, which become searchable later, ensuring a deep contextual understanding when reviewing saved links.

## Learning Objectives

* Building API and Database: Create a robust backend that allows users to save and retrieve links, with functionality for scraping and summarizing web content.
* Implementing Full-Text Search: Enable users to search both the saved links and the summarized content.
* User Authentication: Allow secure logins, ensuring each user has a personal account to manage their saved links.
* Creating a Responsive Frontend: Design an intuitive interface where users can save links, view content summaries, and search for their data.
* Database design: Learn about database design and management for storing user data.
* Gain experience in collaboration and project management within a team.

## Technologies Used

Frontend: React.js/NextJs for building the user interface.
Backend: Django
Database: MySQL for data storage.
Web Scraping: Beautiful Soup (Python) or ScraperAPI for scraping data from websites.
NLP: NLTK or spaCy for content analysis and auto-tagging.
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user logins.
Summarization: Gemini Model for content summarization.
Hosting: Vercel for deploying the application.
Collaboration: AWS, Heroku, or Vercel for deploying the application.

## Challenges Already Identified

* Ensuring the accuracy of scraped data from various website formats.
* Implementing a robust search algorithm for quick retrieval of saved information.
* User Experience Challenges: Creating an intuitive UI that accommodates various user needs and preferences.
* Time Constraints: Managing development within a tight two-week timeframe while ensuring quality.
* Performance Issues: Ensuring fast and efficient content summarization for larger websites.
* Data Privacy: Handling personal data securely while saving and retrieving user content.
* Scalability: Building a solution that can grow with more users and larger amounts of saved data.
